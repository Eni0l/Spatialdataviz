This project focused on optimizing electricity distribution in Lagos, Nigeria. Key activities included geospatial mapping of electrical infrastructure  to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and accountability of electricity distribution.
# Electricity Transmission Company of Nigeria (Lagos Electric Grid Optimization: Enhancing Energy Accountability & Efficiency)

This project aimed to optimize electricity distribution in Lagos, Nigeria by enhancing transformer allocation and billing practices. 

## Problem
The project addressed challenges in determining accurate energy consumption per transformer due to inconsistent customer grouping and illegal tapping of electricity.

## Goals
The goals included geospatial mapping of electrical assets and customers, data segregation for precise billing, and electricity meter implementation for each building and transformer.

## My Role
I was involved in data cleansing, load analysis, network analysis, asset management, and data visualization using ArcGIS Pro's various tools. I utilized ArcGIS Pro to create an operational map to visualize the electrical asset network, data, and analysis results.

## Results
The project resulted in the successful deployment of meters for transformers and buildings, mitigating energy loss. The energy distribution company can now accurately monitor energy allocation per transformer and manage electrical assets. This includes monitoring electricity consumption rates per building, identifying debtors, and tracing energy losses for accurate energy auditing, load distribution, and loss management. Some of the maps produced during the course of the project are presented below:
